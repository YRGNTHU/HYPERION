# HYPERION: Hyperspectral Penetrating-type Ellipsoidal Reconstruction for Terahertz Blind Source Separation

## Description
Code and dataset released for the research paper “HYPERION: Hyperspectral Penetrating-type Ellipsoidal Reconstruction for Terahertz Blind Source Separation”. In the demo, the Quinary Dataset without Pure Substances is used to demonstrate the unmixing efficacy of HYPERION.

## Demo
Users just need to run the Matlab program “main.m” to see the unmixed spectra by HYPERION.

## Dataset
1. Ternary Dataset (N3.mat)
2. Quinary Dataset (N5.mat)
3. Hyperspectral Image Dataset (triangle.mat)

## Contribution
This algorithm is designed and implemented by Chia-Hsiang Lin. The dataset is designed and collected by Yi-Chun Hung and Feng-Yu Wang.
